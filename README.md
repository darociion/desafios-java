# Java challenges (Oracle Next Education)


This repository compiles the different challenges proposed in the [Alura Latam](https://github.com/alura-es-cursos) / Oracle Java Back-End course, part of the ONE program.

1. The 1st challenge consists of creating a mini banking system, in which the user, through the use of a menu, can check their bank balance, as well as deposit and withdraw cash according to their needs.

2. The 2nd challenge consists of creating a system that simulates an audio playback application, both for songs and podcasts, working on the concepts of encapsulation and inheritance.

3. The 3rd challenge consists of creating a system that simulates a shopping application in which the user initially enters the limits of their credit card, then is asked to enter the name of the product they want to buy and then its price. The system controls that the user cannot exceed the limits of the balance initially entered. At the end, the list of purchases made is displayed on the screen with their respective price and ordered in ascending order, working on the concepts of lists and collections.

4. The 4th challenge consists of creating a system that consults the information of the different Star Wars movies through the consumption of the [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) API. In this challenge I work on the concepts of API, files and errors management.

5. The 5th challenge consist of creating a system that consults the information from the [Gutendex Api](https://gutendex.com/) to let the user search his favorite books, show him the top 10 downloaded books and search by title or period. In this challenge I work with first concepts of spring framework.
